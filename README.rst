What is this
------------

This is a very easy script I wrote to determine what to do.
Sometimes I want to do so many things at once, and I can't
make a choice. That's what I wrote this script for.

To use, just rename cando.yml.example to cando.yml, fill in
some things you can do (it can handle unlimited number of
categories or options), and run ./letsdo.py.


Note: the contents of the example file are not meant to be
limiting. Feel free to add whatever you like to do!
